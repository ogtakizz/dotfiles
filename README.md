I won't make a script to automate all of this because i'm too lazy. I'll simply make a step by step so i don't forget anything.

Post install (i use arch btw)

run "sudo pacman -S git"

Then, with git installed, clone this repository to your root
"git clone https://github.com/ogtakizz/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles"

Install the apps on the Installation file

Then you create your symbolic links (i don't know how to use stow yet)

You're ready to go...i think...
